Most owners who ask "should we move off QuickBooks?" have not actually hit a wall. They have hit a workaround that got out of hand: inventory tracked in a spreadsheet next to the accounting file, three companies consolidated by hand every month, a class structure nobody set up on purpose. That is a different problem than outgrowing the software, and it has a much cheaper fix.

This guide gives you an honest test. First, learn to tell a genuine ceiling from a setup problem. Then, if it really is a ceiling, understand what Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) actually buys you, what it honestly costs in time and money, and how to decide with a checklist instead of a gut feeling.

## What QuickBooks is and is not built to do

QuickBooks is an accounting system. It records transactions, produces financial statements, runs payroll, and handles accounts payable and receivable. It does those things well for a wide range of businesses, and it keeps doing them well past the point where most people assume they have outgrown it.

What it is not is a system that runs your whole operation. It does not deeply manage multi-warehouse inventory, complex manufacturing, project costing across dozens of live jobs, or the automatic consolidation of several legal entities. Intuit sets limits on the online product that scale by plan — the number of billable users, and on some tiers the classes and locations you can use to segment reporting. You can compare the plans and what each includes on [Intuit's QuickBooks Online plans page](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/pricing/). If you are bumping into those limits, that is a real signal. If you are not, the problem is almost certainly how the file is set up.

## The four signals people mistake for "we've outgrown it"

These are the complaints that send owners shopping for ERP. Each one can be a genuine ceiling or a fixable setup problem. The difference matters.

**Inventory lives in a spreadsheet.** A distributor with ~40 staff keeps stock levels, reorder points, and landed cost in Excel because "QuickBooks can't do it." Sometimes true, if you have multiple warehouses, serial or lot tracking, or assembly. Often it is just that nobody turned on inventory tracking or connected an inventory add-on. Ceiling or setup? Ask whether the spreadsheet exists because the software can't, or because no one built it in.

**You consolidate multiple entities by hand.** Three companies, one owner, and every month someone exports three profit-and-loss statements into a fourth spreadsheet to see the whole picture. QuickBooks does not consolidate entities natively. This one is usually a real ceiling once you have more than two entities and need consolidated reporting on a schedule.

**Month-end takes two weeks.** A slow close feels like a software failure. Usually it is a process failure: manual bank reconciliations, uncategorized transactions piling up, no accruals discipline, journal entries retyped from memory. A slow close is far more often a workflow issue than a QuickBooks issue. Before you blame the tool, see [[Closing your books faster with automation]] — most of that time is recoverable without changing systems.

**Two systems disagree on the same number.** Your customer relationship manager says you sold $1.2M, QuickBooks says $1.1M, and the warehouse system says something else again. This is not always a QuickBooks problem either. It is usually an integration problem — three systems with no single source of truth. [[Making your software talk to each other]] covers the fix, which is often cheaper than a full replacement.

Here is the quick sort:

| Signal | Usually a setup problem when… | Usually a real ceiling when… |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Inventory in spreadsheets | Single location, no assembly, tracking was never turned on | Multiple warehouses, lot/serial tracking, manufacturing |
| Manual consolidation | Two entities, occasional reporting | Three or more entities needing scheduled consolidated statements |
| Two-week close | Manual reconciliations, no accrual discipline | Genuine transaction volume beyond the plan's limits |
| Systems disagree | No integration between existing tools | Data model can't represent the business (e.g., project costing) |

## What ERP actually buys you

ERP is one shared database that several departments write to and read from: accounting, inventory, purchasing, sales orders, sometimes manufacturing and project costing. The point is not more features. The point is one source of truth, so the number is the same everywhere and you stop reconciling systems against each other.

That is genuinely valuable when your operation is complex enough to need it. A light manufacturer that builds finished goods from raw materials, a distributor running several warehouses, or a professional-services firm costing hundreds of live projects all benefit from having one system that knows about the money and the operation at the same time. For a single-location service business with clean books, ERP is expensive overkill.

## The honest cost and timeline

This is where the conversation gets real. A mid-market ERP implementation typically runs about five to seven months from decision to go-live, and that assumes you have someone internally who can own the project. The work is not installing software. It is redesigning processes, migrating years of data, mapping your chart of accounts into a new structure, training people, and running the old and new systems in parallel until you trust the new one.

Budget for three kinds of cost that catch people off guard:

- **Software subscription** — recurring, and it scales with users and modules.
- **Implementation** — usually several times the first year of software cost, because the labor to configure and migrate is the real expense.
- **Internal time** — someone on your team loses a meaningful slice of their job to this project for the duration, and that cost is invisible until it isn't.

The failure pattern to avoid: buying the software first and figuring out the process later. ERP does not fix a broken process; it automates it faster. Fix the model first, then buy.

## Fix the model before you buy: what to try this week

Before you spend six months and a real budget, spend a week ruling out the cheap fixes. Work down this list in order:

1. **Check whether you are actually at a QuickBooks limit.** Compare your user count and class/location usage against the tiers on [Intuit's QuickBooks Online plans page](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/pricing/). If you have room, the software is not your ceiling.
2. **Turn on the features you are working around.** Inventory tracking, classes for departmental reporting, projects for job costing — many businesses buy ERP to get capabilities their current plan already includes.
3. **Fix the close, not the software.** Time your month-end close and find the two steps that eat the most days. They are usually manual and automatable. See [[Closing your books faster with automation]].
4. **Connect your systems instead of replacing them.** If the pain is systems disagreeing, an integration between existing tools is far cheaper than one platform to rule them all. See [[Making your software talk to each other]].
5. **Get the reporting you need without a migration.** If the real complaint is "I can't see the whole business," a reporting layer on top of your current systems may be the answer, not a new operational core. See [[From spreadsheets to dashboards]].

If you work through all five and still have a genuine ceiling — multiple warehouses, several entities to consolidate on a schedule, manufacturing, or account counts past the caps — then ERP is the right conversation.

## The decision checklist

You have probably outgrown QuickBooks if you can check three or more of these, honestly:

- [ ] You have hit Intuit's published limits on accounts, users, or classes and locations.
- [ ] You run three or more legal entities and consolidate them on a fixed schedule.
- [ ] You manage inventory across multiple locations, or with lot, serial, or assembly tracking.
- [ ] You do real manufacturing or multi-stage project costing that your chart of accounts cannot represent.
- [ ] You have already fixed the close, turned on built-in features, and integrated your systems, and the pain remains.
- [ ] You have someone who can own a five-to-seven-month project without dropping their day job.

If you check zero to two, you have a setup or process problem, and the fixes above will save you a large migration. If you check three or more — especially the last one — you are ready to plan an ERP move seriously.

## Watch-outs that bite people

- **Buying software to fix a process.** ERP automates whatever process you feed it. Design the process first, or you will pay to make the mess run faster.
- **Underestimating internal time.** The subscription and implementation quotes are visible; the months your best operator spends on the project are not. That hidden cost sinks more ERP projects than the sticker price does.
- **Migrating everything.** You do not need twelve years of transaction history in the new system. Decide what to bring, archive the rest, and start clean where you can.

## Your next step

If you have honestly worked the checklist and landed on the "real ceiling" side, the move is worth doing well and worth doing once. A scoped assessment — what you have, what you actually need, and whether to fix the model or replace it — is the cheapest way to avoid a six-month mistake. See [[ERP consulting]] for how that assessment works, or [tell us where you're stuck](/contact/) and we'll help you tell a ceiling from a setup problem before you spend a dollar on software.
