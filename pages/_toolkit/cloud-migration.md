"Moving to the cloud" sounds like one big project. It almost never is. For most small businesses it is a series of small, low-risk switches: your email moves first, then your files, then the applications you run every day, and only rarely the server humming in a closet. This guide explains what each of those steps means, what it honestly costs, and how to stage the move over a few weekends instead of one nerve-wracking weekend.

## What "the cloud" actually means

The cloud is just someone else's computers, rented by the month, reached over the internet. Instead of buying a server, installing software on it, and keeping it patched and backed up yourself, you pay a provider to run that for you and you connect from any device. That is the whole idea.

It helps to sort cloud services into three layers, because you migrate them in roughly this order:

- **Email and files.** Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace for mailboxes, calendars, and documents. This is where almost every business starts. It is low-risk, well-documented, and the vendors have guided migration paths.
- **Business applications.** Your accounting system, customer relationship manager, scheduling tool, or point-of-sale. Many of these already have a hosted version you subscribe to instead of installing. Switching often means exporting your data and importing it into the vendor's online edition.
- **Infrastructure.** The actual servers and databases that run custom or older software. Moving these into Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure is the deepest layer, and the one most small businesses either do last or never do at all.

A dental clinic might move email and files and stop there, because its practice-management software is already hosted by the vendor. A light-manufacturing shop with a custom order system may eventually move that server too. Both are "in the cloud." Neither had to boil the ocean.

## The honest cost model

The most common myth is that the cloud is always cheaper. Sometimes it is; sometimes it just moves the cost from a big occasional purchase to a steady monthly bill. What actually changes is the shape of the spending.

| | Server in a closet | Cloud services |
|---|---|---|
| Up-front cost | High: buy hardware every 4–5 years | Low: little or none |
| Monthly cost | Low, but hidden | Predictable subscription per user or per use |
| Who patches and backs up | You (or a contractor you pay) | The provider, for the layers they run |
| Scaling up | Buy a bigger box | Change a plan |
| Cost when idle | You paid for it either way | You still pay if you leave things running |

The honest version: a business with a single aging file server and 15 staff often comes out ahead on the cloud once you count the contractor visits, the after-hours patching, and the eventual hardware replacement. A business running heavy custom software 24 hours a day can find that "pay for what you use" becomes "pay for what you forgot to turn off." The savings are real but they are not automatic. Budget on a per-user, per-month basis for the email and application layers, and treat any infrastructure move as a project with its own estimate.

One watch-out that bites people: cloud pricing is a running meter. An unused test server, an oversized database, or a mailbox for an employee who left three months ago all keep billing. Assign one person to review the bill monthly.

## A phased migration you can stage

You do not need a single cutover. Stage it so that if one phase goes sideways, the rest of the business keeps running.

**Phase 1 — Email and calendars (week 1–2).** Pick Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace, add your users, and use the vendor's migration tool to copy existing mail across. Microsoft publishes a step-by-step path for exactly this in its [Microsoft 365 migration documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/mailbox-migration/mailbox-migration). Run old and new in parallel for a few days before you switch the mail flow.

**Phase 2 — Files and documents (week 2–4).** Move shared drives into OneDrive/SharePoint or Google Drive. Do this in batches by department so you can fix permissions as you go. Keep the old file server read-only for a month as a safety net.

**Phase 3 — Business applications (month 2).** For each app, ask the vendor whether a hosted edition exists and how you export your data into it. Migrate one app at a time. Accounting and payroll are usually best moved during a quiet period, not at month-end or quarter-end.

**Phase 4 — Infrastructure, only if needed (month 3+).** If you still have a custom or legacy server, this is where it moves. This is the phase where bringing in help pays for itself, because it involves networking, security groups, and testing that the application behaves the same in its new home.

## Security and compliance basics

Moving to the cloud does not hand security to the provider entirely. It splits the job. The provider secures the buildings, the hardware, and the platform; you are responsible for your accounts, your data, and who can see it. AWS calls this the [shared responsibility model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/), and every major provider works the same way.

Your side of that split is mostly the same handful of controls no matter which provider you choose:

- Turn on multi-factor authentication for every account, especially administrators.
- Give people only the access they need, and remove access the day someone leaves.
- Confirm what the provider backs up and what it does not — many cover the platform but not your individual files or mailboxes.
- If you handle health, card, or regulated data, check that the service and plan you buy actually meet that standard before you migrate.

These are the same fundamentals covered in [[The security baseline every small business needs]], and they matter more in the cloud, not less, because your systems are now reachable from anywhere.

## Avoiding vendor lock-in

Lock-in is what happens when leaving a provider becomes so painful you stay out of inertia rather than choice. You cannot avoid it entirely, but you can keep the door open:

- **Own your data in a portable form.** Confirm before you sign that you can export everything in a standard format (comma-separated values, PDF, standard mailbox files). If the answer is vague, that is a red flag.
- **Prefer standards over proprietary features.** The more you build on a vendor's unique add-ons, the harder it is to leave. Use them when they earn their keep, not by default.
- **Keep an exit note.** Write down, per service, how you would get your data out and roughly what it would take. A one-page note per system saves you months later.

## A readiness checklist

Before you start Phase 1, you should be able to check most of these:

- [ ] You have an inventory of what you run today: email, file shares, and each business application.
- [ ] You know how many active users you actually have.
- [ ] You have decided between Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace for email and files.
- [ ] You have a reliable internet connection at each location, with a backup path if the internet is critical to daily work.
- [ ] You know which data is regulated (health, payment, personal) and what rules apply.
- [ ] One person owns the monthly bill and the account list.
- [ ] You have a rollback plan for each phase — the old system stays available, read-only, for a while.

## A rough timeline

For a typical business of 10–50 people, a full move runs about one to three months:

- **Month 1:** email and files migrated; users comfortable on the new tools.
- **Month 2:** business applications moved one at a time; old systems kept read-only.
- **Month 3:** any remaining infrastructure moved, or a decision made to leave it where it is.

Smaller businesses that only need email and files can finish in two to three weeks. There is no prize for rushing the later phases.

## Where to get help

You can do Phases 1 and 2 yourself with the vendor's guides and a careful weekend. Phase 3 depends on how tidy your data is. Phase 4 — moving real infrastructure while the business keeps running — is where a second set of experienced hands protects you from the mistakes that cause outages.
