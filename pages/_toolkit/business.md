These guides are written for the person who runs the business, not an IT department. The examples span a law office, a construction firm, a dental clinic, a distributor, a multi-location retailer, and a nonprofit — because the underlying technology needs are remarkably similar once you look past the industry. Each guide tells you what the capability is, whether you can do it yourself, where the real risk is, and when it's worth bringing in help.

These guides are meant to make you self-sufficient. When a project is bigger than a weekend — a real migration, an audit deadline, a system that has to keep running while you change it — that's when a conversation helps. [Tell us what's slowing you down](/contact/) and we'll point you to the right guide or the right next step.
